A very simple start level Tetris Game
Developed in C++
Library Used for Graphics and Fonts: SDL (www.libsdl.org)

Created at around 2010 when I was just learning C++ and games. So the solutions are not perfect and many OOP principles have been violated :D

I will be re-factoring the code if possible.
Enjoy
